Why am I making this post and what is it about you might ask?

Well, since I have gotten the Tundra trackers, specifically the three tracker set with an SW7 dongle upgrade, I noticed the dongle itself getting pretty warm, so warm, in fact that you can burn yourself after some play time, more specifically, with an average room temperature of ~17°C (~62°F) the outside of the tundra tracker got 65°C (150°F) hot.


Wanting to use the dongle inside of the Valve Index’s frunk is of course a no go like this. That is why I decided to open it and have a quick look around.

I found the easiest way to open the dongle, with the least amount of damage to the plastic welded seam, is from the back. Get a thin metal spudger in the middle and twist it, it should pop right open.

Following are some pictures of the insides. First of all the two big front and back pictures.


I have the SW7 dongle, as said earlier, and we can see the PCB is version 3, as well as that the same PCB is used for the SW5 and SW7 dongle. That is common practice to do, I just wonder why the SW3 are not included in this. Sadly, I do not have a SW3 to open it.

As we can see here, it is relatively packed. We can see the USB hub controller and three ‘dongles’ on the front side, as well as 4 ‘dongles’ on the back side. We can also see the thermal pad on the USB hub controller, which is transferring the heat to the… uh… plastic housing? Fair enough.

Let us see some closeups, first we start with the front.


Here we can take a closer look onto our USB hub controller, let’s go further.


We can see the USB hub controller is 8mm x 8mm, manufactured by SMSC (Microchip). The part number is USB2517-JZX, a generic programmable high performance, small footprint hub controller IC with seven downstream ports, as we can see it is seven by the USB***7 part number, and an internal 1.8V voltage regulator. It operates at 3.3V and has a temperature range of 0°C (32°F) up to 70°C (158°F). The other blocks are customizable Vendor ID, Product ID and Device ID.

As you can see from the specifications the USB hub controller nearly reaches its max temperature while in use. While idling the temperature is lower, but the dongle does not have an energy saving mode and never turns the USB hub controller off. There is a USB hub controller with the part number USB251*i, that one is capable of sustaining the industrial temperatures of -40°C (-40°F) up to 85°C (185°F). Would they use that one we wouldn’t have a problem with the temperature, not looking at how hot the ‘dongles’ get and what they can safely operate at.

How are they trying to remove the heat generated by the USB hub controller?

They are using a thermal pad of 14mm x 14mm x 2mm, directly in contact of the USB hub controller and the plastic housing. Yes, plastic housing, more specifically the part with the Tundra Labs logo on it. This might be enough for when you use the dongle on your desk, for example, but certainly not enough to use it inside the Valve Index’s frunk.

Now let’s take a quick look at the back side of the dongles PCB.


Not much going on here, except for more ‘dongles’, which adds up to seven for this SW7 dongle.

So, now you might think “Thanks for the info I guess”, to that I say, no problem! But this isn’t just only the point of this post, everyone with an SW7 dongle knows it gets way too hot.

Following I will start modding and upgrading the SW7 dongle to, first of all, dissipate the heat. After that, other things will follow. I will update this forum post once I am done with said upgrades and mods.

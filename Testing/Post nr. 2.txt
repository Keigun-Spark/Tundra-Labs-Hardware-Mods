So, things are going different than planned because I mistook the case of the dongle as all plastic, which it is not.


However, this heat sink was not bare metal, as you can see from previous images. It kind of looks like it was painted, I am not so sure.

Anyways I sanded it off and will order a new 2mm thermal pad. I will re run some tests with the new pad and bare metal to see how different the outcome will be before I continue with different modifications.

I will publish my measurements once all are done.

Right now I can say, you can to 100% use the SW7 dongle while laying it on the table, where there is enough air circulation. At an average room temperature of 21.7°C (71.06°F), with 52% humidity, over a 30 minute test run, the dongle reached an average temperature of 36.3°C (97.34°F) with a hot spot of 48.5°C (119.3°F). This is well below the maximum operating temperature and will do no harm to the dongle.

You should refrain from using the dongle inside the Valve Index’s frunk. During the test the frunk temperature reached 68.2°C (154.76°F) which is just 1.8K (Kelvin) below the USB hubs operating temperature, of 70°C (158°F). While the dongle itself reached a peak hot spot of 65.7°C (150,26°F), or 4.3K (Kelvin) below the USB hubs operating temperature.

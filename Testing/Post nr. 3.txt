In short, using the SW7 dongle on its own is never a problem and a modification would result in no further improvements. The average temperature was 36.6°C (97.88°F), which is well inside its operating temperature.

Using the factory dongle inside the Valve Index’s frunk is not advised. To protect the dongle the tests were ended after 30min, the unmodified dongle reached a temperature of average 63.4°C (146.12°F), which is just shy of the USB hub’s maximum operating temperature.

Modifying the dongle for better heat dissipation resulted in a slower temperature rise. The test ended after 65min where it reached near equilibrium with an average temperature of 62.6°C (144.68°F) and a peak temperature of 66.1°C (150,98°F).

Modifying the dongle further with active ventilation resulted in exceedingly good results, the test reached equilibrium after 40min with an average temperature of 52.2°C (125.96°F) and a peak temperature of just 54.8°C (130.64°F).

As this is an independent test, done not even close to lab environment, I take no responsibility or liability if something gets damaged, someone gets hurt or otherwise. These results are not meant to be used in any official report unless otherwise agreed upon with me Julian / Keigun.
